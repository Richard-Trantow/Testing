The files in this depository are mostly me screwing around, trying to figure 
    out Unix, Python, and R. 
It also contains a script and some experimental files used while learning
    how to use Git.

dogescript.sh is a bash script that does a few basic things:
    1. Welcomes you to the script.
    2. Fetches a list of all connected users on the network.
    3. Sets variables to demonstrate variable-calling.
    4. Paranoidly makes correlations between the number 27 and the Illuminati.
    5. Lies to you.
    6. Lists the contents of the folder /GitHub (assuming you have one).
    7. Doges up your stdout and doges off.
    
Future updates pending!
